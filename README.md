# odin-landing-page
A landing page project for The Odin Project, using CSS and HTML.

The goal of the project is to create a design from the provided [link](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png).

## Notes on the project

- Get the page as close to the design, but it doesn't have to be pixel-perfect.
- Feel free to change the content.
- When you are using images, remember to credit the creator.

## Steps to create the project

1. Look at the design and break it into sections.
2. Write down the specific tags to each part of the design.
3. Look at each section and make style notes. How are they arranged in the page? What fonts and colors will you use?
4. Create the HTML file and CSS files. Implement your notes into code. Start with HTML first then move to CSS.
5. Adjust accordingly. Remember to commit often!
